## Are you ready for Python projects?

You don’t need to be a Python expert to start building projects. 

However, you should first know the basics of Python programming, such as how to write and run simple code and use [functions](https://mimo.org/glossary/python/functions).

If you’re not there yet, we recommend taking a [Python basics course](https://mimo.org/blog/best-python-online-courses-with-certificates) that teaches you fundamentals through practice and theory. 

For example, you can try Mimo’s [Python Career Path](https://mimo.org/courses/python-development) and access both Python learning and real-world projects.

Now, let’s go over the best Python projects you can build once you have mastered the basics.

## Best overall Python projects for beginners

Here are our favorite Python projects for beginners, ranging from super simple to more challenging ones. Some require only basic Python knowledge, while others are better suited for those with more experience. 

We’ve also included links to the source code and instructions to help you build them.

It’s an excellent way to learn how to process text data and train an AI model to make decisions. 

**Skills developed:**

  * Text processing
  * Basic AI classification
  * Working with email data
  * Training machine learning models
  * Data cleaning and preparation

## How to find more beginner Python project ideas 

Building projects is essential if you want to learn Python, but finding the right idea can be tricky. 

The guided projects we shared can be a great starting point. 

But as you progress, you can also come up with your own ideas and build a portfolio with real-world projects. Here are some tips on how to do it:

  * **Automate your work tasks** : Look at repetitive things you do at work—like renaming hundreds of files, updating spreadsheets, or generating reports. Build a Python script to do these tasks for you.

  * **Build tools for others** : Ask your colleagues or friends what takes too much time in their work or studies. A marketer might need help downloading campaign data, or a teacher could use a tool for grading assignments. Real problems make great projects.

  * **Start with hobbies** : For example, are you into photography? Build a tool to rename and organize photos. 

  * **Improve tutorial projects** : You can also build on the tutorial projects by adding more features. For instance, take a basic calculator and add scientific functions, or upgrade a weather app to show weekly forecasts.

  * **Use ChatGPT (or another AI chatbot) for ideas** : Tell [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) about your job and interests: “I’m a marketer learning Python. What could I automate?” or “I love chess and want to build my first Python project.” It will suggest specific projects matching your background.
